Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

All Inspector findings are related to the CloudFormation code we deployed.
We should eliminate the web services's inbound rules allowing traffic from anywhere except from the application load balancer security group.


All three high-severity issues that Security Hub found are related to the CloudFormation code. 
We should fix these by removing SSH access to our instances, instead using immutable instances,
 changing the default security group in our VPC to restrict all traffic; and removing the security group inbound and outbound rules that allow all traffic on all ports from all protocols.
